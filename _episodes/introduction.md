## Overview/Motivation
A great deal of high-performance software is written in C, C++, and Fortran. Running programs written in these languages as more than "black boxes" will require some knowledge of the languages they are written in.

In this workshop we will write a C++ program starting from an empty text file which incorporates many of the main concepts of C++. In doing so we will gain a foundation to allow us to start understanding other people's C++ programs.

We will cover concepts such as object oriented programming, polymorphism, interfaces, and templates. Interfaces being a common, but certainly not the only, way to extend functionality in C++ programs and libraries. The idea of interfaces will be introduced during the 'Abstract classes' episode towards the end of the workshop.


## Are we all setup?

Before we begin make sure you have completed the steps in the [setup](../setup) page. If you have had difficulty with any part of them, now is the time to let us know and we will help you solve them.
