The topics in C and C++ are vast, I have only covered the core concepts and have left out many newer features added to the language.


## Further topics on templates
* Class Templates
* Template specialization
* Non-type parameters

See this [cplusplus.com page](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/) on templates.

## Further fairly important topics in C/C++
* [fstream](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/) (file input/output)
* [assert](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/) (very good programming practice, not just a C++ topic but also a C topic)

## Some less important but possibly interesting topics
* [Exceptions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/exception/exception/)
* C++11 [`auto` keyword](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto)

# Some seriously advanced stuff
* C++11 [multi-threading](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/multithreading/)
