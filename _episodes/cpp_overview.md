## C/C++ as compared to other languages
* C/C++ is a powerful low level language which allows you to work closer to the hardware, a little above assembly.
  * With great power comes great responsibility
  * Write fast code slowly
* Other modern languages, C#, Java, Python, etc. generally provide higher level control of computers
  * Less responsibility but also less power/flexibility
  * Write slow code fast
* Fortran
  * Fast (comparable to well written C/C++)
  * Specialized for numerical computing
  * Awkward for some tasks (I/O, string manipulation, code reuse)
  * Smaller user community
  
## What does C++ add to C?
To main high level components added:
* Classes: forms the basis for what is known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Templates: allows for generic programming, write code that can be used on multiple data types
