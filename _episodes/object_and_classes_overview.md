* Namespaces are a way of grouping names:
  * names of functions, names of constants, names of objects, etc.
  * `std` is the "standard" namespace which contains the C++ standard library [https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)
  * Helps to avoid name clashes, e.g. `std::list` versus some custom made `list` class
