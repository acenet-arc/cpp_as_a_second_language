We will be working on a Compute Canada (CC) or virtual cluster with all the tools we will need already installed. You will need a method of connecting to either a CC cluster, or our virtual cluster, which means you will need a method of connecting to them using [SSH](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/SSH). SSH can be used from a terminal which we explain how to install and open in the **Ensure you can open a terminal** section below.

# Compute Canada Account
If you already have a Compute Canada account you can log into a CC cluster to follow along. A CC account will allow you to continue to use the same environment that you used during the workshop after the workshop has completed.
* Graham: `ssh graham.computecanada.ca`
* Cedar: `ssh cedar.computecanada.ca`
* BÃ©luga: `ssh beluga.computecanada.ca`

### Don't have a Compute Canada account?
For those who do not have a CC account, we will provide a virtual cluster that you can use during the workshop, however you will loose access to it shortly after.

# Ensure you can open a terminal
The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal.

### Windows
[MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended for Windows computers. Download and install MobaXterm **home installer edition**. The portable version will not keep files from one session to the next. Verify you can run mobaXterm and "start local terminal".

### Mac/Linux
You already have a terminal built in.

To see how to open your terminal on your **Mac** see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw).

If you are a **Linux** user running Ubuntu, the first 30 seconds of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUvH2iRizU) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the workshop.
