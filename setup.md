We will be working on a Compute Canada (CC) or virtual cluster with all the tools we will need already installed. You will need a method of connecting to either a CC cluster, or our virtual cluster, which means you will need a method of connecting to them using [SSH](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/SSH). SSH can be used from a terminal which we explain how to install and open in the **Ensure you can open a terminal** section below. 

# Compute Canada Account

To access a CC cluster you will need a Compute Canada account. A CC account will allow you to continue to use the same environment that you used during the workshop after the workshop has completed. Getting a CC account usually takes a few business days. Ensuring you have a CC account at least a week before the workshop begins is recommended.

### How to get an account
To get a CC account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada **or** know someone who is that can sponsor your CC account. To get a CC account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

### Unable to get an account?
If you would like a CC account but are having difficulty getting one, please contact [chris.geroux@ace-net.ca ](mailto:chris.geroux@ace-net.ca ) and we will help you get one.

For those who are unable to acquire a CC account or do not want to continue using the CC clusters after the workshop, we will provide a virtual cluster that you can use during the workshop, however you will loose access to it shortly after.

# Ensure you can open a terminal
The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal.

### Windows
[MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended for Windows computers. Download and install MobaXterm **home installer edition**. The portable version will not keep files from one session to the next. Verify you can run mobaXterm and "start local terminal".

### Mac/Linux
You already have a terminal built in.

To see how to open your terminal on your **Mac** see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw).

If you are a **Linux** user running Ubuntu, the first 30 seconds of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUvH2iRizU) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the workshop.
