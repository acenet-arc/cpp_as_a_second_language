We will be working on a Compute Canada (CC) or virtual cluster with all the tools we will need already installed. You will need a method of connecting to either a CC cluster, or our virtual cluster, which means you will need a method of connection to them using [SSH](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/SSH).

## Getting a Compute Canada account

Before arriving for the course, if you can, it is strongly recommended to get a Compute Canada account. Getting a Compute Canada account usually takes a few business days. Ensuring you have a Compute Canada account at least a week before the course begins is recommended.

### To get a Compute Canada account
To get a Compute Canada account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or know someone who is that can sponsor your Compute Canada account. To get a Compute Canada account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

### If you are unable to get a Compute Canada account
If you would like a Compute Canada account but are having difficulty getting one please contact [chris.geroux@ace-net.ca ](mailto:chris.geroux@ace-net.ca ) and we will help you get one.

For those who are unable to acquire a Compute Canada account we will provide a virtual cluster that you can use during the course. However, having your own CC account is preferable as you may continue to use it after the course has completed.

## Ensure you can open a terminal

The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal.

### Windows
[MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. Download and install MobaXterm **home installer edition**. The portable version will not keep files from one session to the next. Verify you can run mobaXterm and "start local terminal". 

### Linux/Mac
You already have a terminal built in.

To see how to open your terminal on your **Mac** see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw).

If you are a **Linux** user running Ubuntu the first 30 seconds of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUvH2iRizU) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the course.
